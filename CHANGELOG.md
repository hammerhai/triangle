### Removed

Triangle is made on the belief that the path to directories should be given, no more than that. Adding more functionality than just returning a path of a directory would defeat the purpose of many other packages out there. In a way, it could be noted as anti-competitive.

For this specific deprecation, the use of `dart:io` is recommended as an alternative.
