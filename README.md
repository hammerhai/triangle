# Triangle

A package based on the [ðŸ¦€ directories crate](https://crates.io/crates/directories) from Rust, made for ðŸŽ¯ Dart with a few modifications.

## Getting started

Using Triangle is simple, include the following lines in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  triangle: ^1.0.0
```

```yaml
dependencies:
  triangle:
    git: https://github.com/hammerhai/triangle.git
```

Either of these two formats will work, one may be more unstable than the other.

## Usage

For specific use cases, take a look in the `/example` folder.
